# Dropdown Widget

This widget works with the ```dropdown-check-button``` to create interactive dropdown-based pseudocode problems. If the answers are not correct, the try count increments by one and an alert pops up to try again. If the answers are correct, a layer is triggered to display on the map.

## Usage

In the settings panel, enter a series of options you want to display in the dropdown. The options will shuffle automatically. Make sure the correct answer is entered first in the list. Click the update button to load the options into the dropdown widget.
