# Dropdown Check Answer

This widget checks that all of the answers selected in each ```dropdown-widget``` are correct. If the answers are not correct, the try count increments by one and an alert pops up to try again. If the answers are correct, a layer is triggered to display on the map.

## Usage

In the settings panel, choose a map to connect to and enter any number of layer URL(s) that will display when the user gets the correct set of answers.
